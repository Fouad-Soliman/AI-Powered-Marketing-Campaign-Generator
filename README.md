By providing key inputs such as customer segment, budget, campaign theme, and legal restrictions, this tool automates and enhances the campaign ideation process, ensuring efficient and impactful marketing strategies.

##  Key Features
- **AI-Driven Campaign Generation**: Generates customized marketing campaigns based on user inputs.
- **Customer-Centric Recommendations**: Tailors suggestions based on customer segmentation and market trends.
- **Multi-Channel Strategy**: Supports multiple communication and growth channels.
- **Legal Compliance Considerations**: Ensures campaigns adhere to platform-specific legal restrictions.
- **Insightful Data Analysis**: Uses customer data and trends to suggest the most effective strategies.

## üîÑ How It Works
1. **User Input**: The marketer provides details such as customer segment, budget, business objective, campaign theme, and preferred communication channels.
2. **AI Processing**: The LLM analyzes the provided information and generates marketing campaign ideas.
3. **Content Evaluation**: A review module assesses the AI-generated content for relevance and quality.
4. **Final Output**: The tool presents a structured marketing campaign, ready for deployment or further refinement.

## üîç Assumptions
- We assumed that customers are already segmented, and the marketer will input the target audience (customer segment). This segmentation was created using collected data for digital marketing analysis ([https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vguKu-j89cHYBAarNUGEBWo_IDnaXz06?usp=sharing]).
- A simple customer segmentation was performed on this dataset using clustering since the data did not include predefined customer segments.
- We assumed that our generated clusters represent the customer segments that marketers will input.
